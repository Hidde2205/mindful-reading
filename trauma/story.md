Paper Hands



Dante wasn't supposed to stay in the game this long.

At first, it was survival - a way to keep the lights on in the crumbling apartment he shared
with his mom. The odd jobs were easy money: running packages, keeping his head down, asking no questions. His boss, Rick, liked him. Said he had
"potential". Dante didn't want potential; he wnated out.

But money talks. And in their neighborhood, money screams.



It started with a stack of bills Rick handed him one night. "For your mom's surgery," he said. "You don't owe me, kid. Just remember who looked out
for you." Dante wasn't stupid. He knew what that meant. And when the next job came, he said yes. And the next. And the next. Each time, the pay got
better, the stakes higher. Soon, Dante wasn't just running packages - he was moving weight. Watching people beg. Watching people break.

Some nights, when the city was quiet, he'd sit in the slick leather seat of his new car and wonder when the switch flipped. When did it stop being about survival and start being about the thrill? The respect? The power?




The night it all fell apart started like any other. A pickup, a drop-off, easy money. But Dante's partner, Luis, had been getting sloppy. Paranoid.
"They're watching us, man," he muttered, his hands twitching on the wheel. "We need to bail after this."

Dante didn't answer. He didn't need to. Bailing wasn't an option. Rick made sure of that.

The ambush was fast, brutal. Lights flashed, tires screeched, and before Dante could blink, Luis was pulled from the car, screaming. Dante ran. He didn't think - he just ran, the sound of gunshots cracking behind him like thunder. He didn't stop until his legs gave out, collapsing in an alley that reeked of piss and regret.



Rick called the next day. ‘You good?’ His voice was calm, like nothing had happened.

‘I’m out,’ Dante said, his voice shaking. ‘I’m done, Rick.’ Rick laughed, a low, dangerous sound. ‘You think it's that easy, kid? You think I don't own you? That money I gave you, the car, the respect - you don't walk away from that. You don't walk away from me.’

Dante hung up, but the words stayed with him. He thought about the night his mom cried when he handed her the money for her surgery. How proud she looked, not knowing where it came from. He thought about Luis, his body crumpled on the pavement. He thought about Rick, sitting somewhere in his penthouse, counting money stained with blood.

For the first time, Dante realized the truth: the money was never his. It was a leash, and Rick held the chain.



Dante sat in his apartment that night, staring at the duffel bag full of cash on his kitchen table. His mom’s framed photo smiled at him from the corner,
but he couldn’t meet her eyes. He lit a cigarette with shaking hands, took one long drag, and exhaled.

‘Money ties,’ he muttered to himself, the words bitter on his tongue.

The question wasn’t whether he’d pay the price - it was how much it would cost.
